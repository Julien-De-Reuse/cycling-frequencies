# 🚴 Cycling Frequencies

A Unity game where players pedal to the rhythm!  
Your real-world cycling speed controls the game speed as you follow a car through various environments.  
The car’s movement is based on the audio spectrum of a selected `.mp3` song.

## 🎮 Features (Work in Progress)

- 🎵 Music-synced gameplay using audio spectrum analysis
- 🚗 Car movement responding to music
- 🚴‍♂️ Player speed controlled by real cycling input via Arduino
- ⏱ Countdown before game start
- 🧠 XP system based on distance to the car


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Unity** 6.1 (6000.1.0f1)
- **Arduino Nano** with Hall sensor and push-buttons
- Serial communication with Unity (via COM port)
- *(Optional but postponed)* Heart rate sensor integration
